# Applied Machine Learning Course Repository

Welcome to the Applied Machine Learning course repository! This repository contains assignments and projects for the course, which will introduce you to the fundamental concepts and algorithms of machine learning.

## Course Description
Machine learning has been essential to the success of many recent technologies, including autonomous vehicles, search engines, genomics, automated medical diagnosis, image recognition, and social network analysis. This course will introduce the fundamental concepts and algorithms that enable computers to learn from experience, with an emphasis on their practical application. It will introduce supervised learning (linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks and deep learning, and Bayesian networks), unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

Each assignment will be contained within its own directory.
The directory for each assignment will contain the code and data necessary to complete the assignment.
The README.md file in each assignment directory will contain instructions and guidelines for completing the assignment.
